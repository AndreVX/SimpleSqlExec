SimpleSqlExec is a light-weight tool for running queries on SQL Server. It is not intended (at least at the moment) to run queries against any other RDBMS.

The goal is to provide functionality similar to SQLCMD, but nothing related to being interactive, or reporting client statistics, etc.

Eventually this will allow for options such as "Batch Abort", "Input File", etc
